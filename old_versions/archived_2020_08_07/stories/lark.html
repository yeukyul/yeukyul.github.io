                Lark is a barista in a small coffee shop in Harvard Area, Cambridge. She has a pair of dreamy eyes, always drifting its focus. When you’re talking to her, you wouldn’t think she is paying attention at all — her bright, emerald green eyes would stare blankly at you, as if she is absorbed in her own thoughts.
                </p>
            
            <p class="project-paragraph">
                She is an odd reader — she would have a book with her, but when she reads, she would skim through the lines and remember none of the plots. Yet, she would be able to remember the “feel” of the book. For example, the Scarlet Letter would invoke the same feeling as staring at stained glass, and 1984 planted a picture of a gray prison in her. But after all, she cannot tell you who’re in the story, or what happened to them. Given the way she converses, it sometimes makes you wonder whether she is trying to construct the “feel” of the conversation instead of the actual content when interacting with people.</p>

            <p class="project-paragraph">
                Because of her uniqueness, she has enchanted, or scared away, a lot of people who regularly visit the cafe. Most of them are often Harvard students. From those people she knew, she has gotten a copy of Harvard classes schedule, and she would pick out literature classes and attend them. </p>

                Cameron couldn’t stop noticing Lark in his literature class. Every time she comes to class, she would bring a different book from what was assigned. He found her curious, so he took a seat next to hers this time. </p>
            
            <p class="project-paragraph">
                He started chatting about <i>Save Me the Waltz</i>, the book that she was holding, only to learned she doesn’t know Zelda Fitzgerald at all. He found it hard to believe that, without the intriguing tale of the author, the book can still be appreciated as it is. </p>
            
            <p class="project-paragraph">
                He asked her, “how do you like the book?” She paused a while, seemed to be summarizing her thoughts. Eventually, she said, “I liked it. It’s like a sad, dying wild fire.”
                </p>
            
            <p class="project-paragraph">
                She was staring right at Cameron when she said it. Something in her eyes touched him. He could’t say for sure what it was, but her gaze was like one of a poet — it has a touch of otherworldliness, and he found it spellbinding.
            </p>
            
            <p class="project-paragraph">
                “I’m Cameron. What’s your name?”
                </p>
            
            <p class="project-paragraph">
                “Lark,” she said.
                </p>
            
            <p class="project-paragraph">
                He whispered her name. “<i>Lark</i> — like the bird.”
