                <strong>Context: </strong> The project stems from the hope of better facilitates fellow students in course selection at Carnegie Mellon University (CMU). Currently at CMU, the faculty course evaluation (FCE) dataset is the only way for students to be informed about courses’ teaching history, past ratings, and hours spent per week. However, the data is poorly visualized, not to mention its slow load time. After submitting one query, the site could take up to 5 seconds before the search result is finally displayed in a huge tabular form (urgh).</p>

                <strong>How we solved it: </strong> To help students in understanding courses statistics, Matthew, Sean, and I have decided to revamp the current FCE website. We did the first prototype in a 24-hour hackathon TartanHacks, hosted by Scotty Lab at Carnegie Mellon.</p>
            
            <p class="project-paragraph">Since we only had 24 hours to build it, we need a robust and mature interactive data visualization web framework to do the job. It is simply too time-consuming to build graphics from ground up using D3.js, and Javascript is no good friend in data manipulation. We therefore turned to Shiny in R, which is a framework that elegantly takes in R code and output a web application, utilizing graphing libraries like Plot.ly and HTML widget.</p>
            
            <p class="project-paragraph">Using course API that Scotty Lab provides, we were able to retrieve all course data in JSON format. Matthew gladly took the job of data cleaning and refactoring using Python. Since I was the only person who has prior experience with this framework before, I worked with both the UI and server-side, as well as choice of visualization in R. As for Sean, he helped to build a dataset for all CMU professor ratings on RateMyProfessor.com simply using web scrapping.</p>
            
            <p class="project-paragraph">Given the time that we had, we are proud to say that CMU Eval has all the features that we originally intended. Users are able to compare ratings between course and professors, see teaching history, and even manually choose courses to see total number of unit and number of hour they are expected to spend in a week.</p>

            <p class="project-paragraph">
                <strong>Challenges: </strong> The root of all data visualization problem — to me at least — is missing values. Since I used the data that Matthew cleaned to produce visualization, how we communicate the encoding of missing string or weird values was vital. At the beginning, Matthew simply ignored all the missing values, but that caused some of the row to shift by few columns, and R wasn’t too happy about it. We had to go back and change missing values to explicit NAs.</p>
            
            <p class="project-paragraph">Another interesting problem that we ran into was how to display a time series of a course rating by semester. Semester are encoded in string, such as “Fall 2016” and “Summer I 2017,” but we need to assign numeric value to theses time so that they can line up chronologically on the x-axis in a time series. We ended up encode these terms as float, so “Spring 2017” would be 2017.1, where 2017 signifies the year and decimal points signifies start month of the term. So the four terms of the year are 2017.1, 2017.5, 2017.7 and 2017.8. This was not the perfect solution — there will be a distortion on the graph since we cannot display November and December, but as for now, this will serve our purpose.</p>

                <strong>Outcome and Recognition: </strong> Our hack was awarded as the “Best data visualization” offered by Qualtric in TartanHacks, spring 2017. Student loved the clean layout and visualization. As a matter of fact, more than half of the people in the presentation room raised their hands, wanting this site to be a real tool they can use.</p>
            
            <p class="project-paragraph">After the competition, we decided to move forward with this idea. After a bit of reworking, the load time of the application has cut down in half, and new graphs were introduced. The application finally went live. We once again presented it in CMU social good expo ImpactCMU, and we won the Innovation award winner.</p>
            
            <p class="project-paragraph">We look forward to have it be officially supported by the school, so we no longer have to pay web hosting fee out of our pocket.</p>
            
            <p class="project-paragraph">The application is currently at <a href="https://cmueval.com">cmueval.com</a>.</p>
