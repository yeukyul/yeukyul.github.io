                <strong>Context: </strong> <i>Let’s try something random</i>, we thought, <i>Let’s make a web app that allows user to draw an album art, and we’d play music depends on the “mood” of the artwork</i>. And so Satoru, Sam, David, and I formed a team at PennApps 17 and marched onward with this idea.</p>

            <p class="project-paragraph">
                <strong>Process: </strong> The name Drawd.io is a combination of the word “draw” and “audio,” as well as a mockery to the modern obsession with applications whose name ended with “.io”</p>
            
            <p class="project-paragraph">During the initial one hour that we have made, we have decided on the tech stack that we are going to be working with. To query music, we are going to use the Spotify API to do album art search as well as getting clips of sound tracks. As for framework, we are going with a Node.js and MongoDB. Since we are planning on building a one page web app, no further libraries except JQuery and gsep were needed.</p>
            
            <p class="project-paragraph">Sam was very experienced with back-end, and he was therefore responsible for writing server-side and database. I was both the designer and front-end developer on the project. David helped me with animating elements on the app, while Satoru helped Sam on logic at the back-end.</p>

            <p class="project-paragraph">For the front end, the first hour was all about designing and creating mocks of our UI using Adobe Illustrator. We determined that the web app would be a one-page app given the simplicity of its functionality, and most of the screen transitions would be done using animation.</p>

            <p class="project-paragraph">
                During this time, Sam was constantly exploring how to use point-cloud segmentation to do edge detection on the album art user draw and album arts in the database. The conversations between the frontend and backend were mostly “Oh look how cool this is!” or “Wohoo it worked!”, but we mostly worked in parallel (which I later figured is how industry works).</p>

                    </div>
            
            <p class="project-paragraph">Later on, a more interesting problem that we went into as a group was: how can we query a matching album art using the Spotify API? The API had a certain querying limit, and so realistically speaking, we were not able to search through the entire database to find a matching album. So a workaround was to populate our database and download as much album art as we can, and use only these pre-downloaded data when we were doing an album search. The result of that was an inaccurate search result. Most of the time, the web app would find a decent album art match, but since the data that we were searching from were not comprehensive, the result was not ideal. During the demo time, we received a lot of “wow” and “meh,” but we had a lot of fun during hacking, so it wasn’t really that big of a deal.</p>

            <p class="project-paragraph">Even though we weren’t ranked in the competition, this was an awesome first hackathon, and I couldn’t hope for a better team. Looking back, I only had a few months of experience with web development and prototyping tools when hacking, but it did made me realize how much I enjoy front-end development. This experience had since then shaped my passion.</p>
