                <strong>Context: </strong> Travelogue was an art project that I started in the summer of 2016. Though an engineer in school, I have always been passionate about drawing. When I started traveling around the States during summer, I began drawing postcards to my friends and capturing  some of the landscapes I saw into my sketchbook.</p>

                <figcaption>Some sketch in my triangular sketchbook: New York City Flariton.</figcaption>
            </div>

            <p class="project-paragraph">With this specific mission at heart, I visited East Lansing, New York, Washington D.C., San Francisco, Seattle, Vancouver, and Boston.</p>

                <img class="project-img" src="../Images/Documentations/travelogue/postcard.JPG">
                <figcaption>Hand drawn postcard to my friend.</figcaption>
            </div>

            <p class="project-paragraph">I stopped at Boston for a brief 3 months at the end for summer school. A friend of mine in school encouraged me to print and sell these drawings as postcards, and I did. I scanned all of these prints into Photoshop, walked to a Cambridge local printing store to have them printed and trimmed. Later I put together a poster board of these postcards and started selling them on the street at Harvard Square area.</p>

                <img class="project-img" src="../Images/Documentations/travelogue/posterboard.JPG">
                <figcaption>Set up for selling.</figcaption>

                <figcaption>When I was at Harvard Square.</figcaption>
            </div>

            <p class="project-paragraph">Later on, I walked into local souvenir and stationery stores to sell these postcards, and took two vendor orders from <a href="http://blackinkboston.com/black-ink-cambridge/">Black Ink</a> and <a href="http://www.bobslatestationer.com/">Bob Slates Stationer</a>. It was a truly magical moment when the store managers handed me a cheque addressed to me.</p>

            <p class="project-paragraph">I definitely didn’t foresee that such a spontaneous project could turn into a mini-business. Since I only had less than 3 weeks to complete the whole business cycle, a lot of decisions were made rather hastily. But I ended up earning $900 in 2 weeks just buy doing so, not to mention a lot of people that I have met. It was for sure an unusual experience.</p>
            
            <hr class="section-break">
            <p class="project-paragraph">
                <strong>Interesting Anecdote:</strong> Recalling the first vendor order I received, I was quite amateur and unprepared as a sales person. I took a set of my postcards into Black Ink, hoping to talk to them about selling them in the store. Susan, who was the store manager, happened to be stocking up goods at the cashier. I started off by asking if she would be interested in selling my postcards. She took the sample off my hands, and she went through these cards one by one in silence.</p>
            
            <p class="project-paragraph">After a minute that seemed like eternity, she asked, “How much would you be selling them for?”</p>
            
            <p class="project-paragraph">I was struck by the question and my luck — to be frank, I didn’t think about pricing before I walked in. Susan saw my hesitation, and she offered $0.5 for one card, since that was the price she normally offered for card stock. I didn’t know how to react but to say yes, and so the first vendor order was made to me. This was definitely a wake up call to me to walk into any business conversation prepared, especially for an exchange like this.</p>
            
            <hr class="section-break">
            
            <p class="project-paragraph">
                <strong>Challenges:</strong> There were quite a few unforeseen business challenges. For the first round of printing, I didn’t have a specific plan for quantity of postcards. I made an arbitrary decision of printing 40 postcards for each type, and 20 drawings in total. Because, in the end, I didn’t really know how people would receive it.</p>
            
            <div class="project-img-container">
                <img class="project-img" src="../Images/Documentations/travelogue/print.JPG">
                <figcaption>Print out of the postcards before trimming.</figcaption>
            </div>
            
            <p class="project-paragraph">At the end, the more popular drawings were sold out, causing me having to re-print them, yet the less popular ones were unable to be sold. This is when I realized the importance of tracking sales and inventory accurately. I didn’t do tracking during the process — which is a rather big mistake I made. The lack of record prevented me from making more informed decision in terms of stocking up.</p>
            
            <p class="project-paragraph">Another interesting thing that I observed was how I have disrupted the dynamic of the Harvard Square. There were fixed street performers and homeless people on the street at certain time of the day, days of the week. When I first appear as a seller on the street, some performers appeared uncomfortably or even hostile, since the attention that they received were somewhat driven away. Learning to make peace with them and have friendly exchange was a crucial part for me to have my place in the square. Funny how a corner of the street can be the “owned” territory of others, eh?</p>
