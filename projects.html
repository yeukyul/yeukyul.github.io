            <p>To me, it is troubling how statistical graphs in modern days sacrifice readibility for aesthetics. During a data visualization course, I studied <a href = "https://ramnathv.github.io/pycon2014-r/visualize/ggplot2.html"> grammar of graphics</a> that proposed by Hadley Wickham, the author of R graphing package GGPlot, and am deeply inspired by his effort in striking a balance between aesthetics and usability. Under the supervision of Statistics Professor Sam Ventura, I will be developing an extention of the graphing package GGPlot that aim at allowing user to easily plot linear regression diagnostic graphs in Spring 2017. </p>

The focus of the study is to develop a virtual agent that poessesses social awareness and incorporting that ability in perform tasks. We are currently in designing phase of user studies, modeling how use of rapport can enhance program's effectiveness. My job is to program interfaces that is used in the study, recording user responses.</p>

We are for sure rated as <a href = "http://www.bloomberg.com/news/articles/2015-06-11/five-of-the-best-computer-science-classes-in-the-country">one of the five best CS courses in the United States</a> for a reason. </p>

The prompt of the competition is to predict the probability of whether specific 300 households will buy eggs in the following week, given their transaction history in a grocery store. In the given 8 hours, me and my teammate Cissy Shi, who's from computational finance background, derived a prediction model using linear regression. </p>

            <p>Computing and Statistics come hand in hand, and a place to store data therefore seemed most important. Noticing the gap in my Statistics study, I chose to go to Harvard University Summer School in Summer 2016, learning how to build relational database using SQL and phpMyAdmin. The art involved is, of course, more than just clicking buttons. I learned how to write queries, analyze transcript, and normalize entries. By the end, I completed a project with a fictional local wholesalers. </p>

            <p>During spring 2016, I participated a competition organized by Carnegie Mellon the college of engineering, aiming to implement positive impact in the society to foster acceptance of disabled children. The prompt of the Spring 2016 competition was to create an accessible playground for children with disabilities. We worked in a group of 5, with groupmates from disciplines all across Statistics, Electrical Engineering, and Mechanical Engineering. Our solution was to create tracks around playground that would allow children with difficulties to walk to be on a cart and enjoy the sensations that the playground facilities would bring. <a href = "http://impact-a-thon-2015.weebly.com">View our solution.</a></p>

            <p>When I first started to learn about programming, Python was my right hand. And so when I had to create a term project for the class Fundamentals of programming in Spring 2015, I chose to go for writing a game in Python. This game put together a random maze generation algorithm, autosolving, and little bit of 3D space visualization. It was amateur, but I am nonetheless proud of it. <a href = "https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2I1X3EH-5lg">Here</a> is the video that introduces it. </p>

The end project was selected and presented in Dietrich Undergraduate Colloqium, organized by the Dietrich College of Humanities and Social Sciences. </p>

            <p>This is a story that is not relevant to my professional pursue, but I like to tell nonetheless. During 2016 Summer, I travelled to 7 cities in the States and drew postcards to my friends on my journey. By the end when I was in Cambridge, MA, I made copies of these postcard and sold them on streets and to retail stores (including <a href = "http://blackinkboston.squarespace.com/black-ink-cambridge/">Black Ink</a> and <a href = "http://www.bobslatestationer.com">Bob Slate</a>). At the end, I made approximately $900 of sales in 2 weeks. In case you're interested in what they look like, <a href = "https://www.facebook.com/tiffany.lee.1129/posts/10210222607504531">
