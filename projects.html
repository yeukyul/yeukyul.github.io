            <p>A competition organized by Carnegie Mellon the college of engineering, aiming to implement positive impact in the society to foster acceptance of disabled children. The prompt of the 2016 competition is to create an accessible playground for children with disabilities. We worked in a group of 5, with groupmates from disciplines all across Statistics, Electrical Engineering, and Mechanical Engineering. Our solution is to create tracks around playground that would allow children with difficulty to walk to be on a cart and enjoy the sensations that the playground facilities would bring. </p>

            <p>A data science competition organized by the Statistics department, sponsered by 85.31. The prompt of the competition is for participating teams to predict probability of whether specific 300 households will buy eggs in the following week, given their transaction history. In the given 8 hours, me and my teammate Cissy Shi, who's from computational finance background, derive a prediction model using regression. </p>

            <p>Early in my programming life, Python was my right hand. And so when I had to create a term project for the class Fundamentals of programming, I choose to go for a game in Python. This game put together a random maze generation algorithm, autosolving, and little bit of 3D space visualization. Learn more about my amateur project! </p>

            <p>During 2016 Summer, I traveled to 7 cities in the States and drew postcards to my friends on my way. By the end when I was in Cambridge, MA, I made copies of these postcard and sold them on streets and to retail stores. At the end, I made approximately $900  of sales in 2 weeks. In case you're interested in what they look like, <a href = "travelogue.html">here're</a> more details. </p>

            <p>Computing and Statistics come hand in hand, and a place to store data therefore seemed most important. Noticing the gap in my Statistics study, I choose to go to harvard university for summer school, learning how to build relational database using SQL and phpMyAdmin. The art involved is of course, more than just clicking buttons. I learned how to write queries, analyzing transcript, normalizing entries. By the end, I completed a project with a local wholesalers in building databases the suited their needs.  </p>

We are for sure rated as <a href = "http://www.bloomberg.com/news/articles/2015-06-11/five-of-the-best-computer-science-classes-in-the-country">one of the five best CS courses in the United States</a> for a reason. </p>
