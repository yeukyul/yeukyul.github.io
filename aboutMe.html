        <h1>About Me</h1>
        <p class = "description"> I am a currently a Junior in <strong>Carnegie Mellon University</strong>, majoring in <strong>Statistics</strong>. I love working in data science. To me nothing is more beautiful than the smooth density curve and has the power of predicting future. I am still actively looking for opportunities to learn more statistical methods and techniques and put them in my tool box. My most recent "oh wow" moment is learning how Gaussian method is applied in astrophysics setting, in which I am still trying to grasp the nitty-gritty detail.</p>
        <p class = "description">I am also pursuing a minor in <strong>computer science</strong>. My initial hope is to  use computing to empower advance statistical data processing and analysis, but I'm nonetheless involve in building websites, apps, and games! I am currently a mentor and teaching assistant in computer science, mentoring both in school and Coursera. As soon as school spares me from mathy problem sets, I'm all excited to jump start in self initiated projects.</p>

    <h1>What I'm Up to Now</h1>
        <p class = "description">Three things mostly.<br>
            I am actively looking for research in Statitics to get more hands on experience, hopefully starting a individual research project on my own next semester. Second, I have been waiting for thanksgiving to begin a 4 day hack with my friends, building a web app that provides handy formula searches. Last but not least, I am early on in data visualization, where I have been making plots for different graphs. I will be learning how to create interactive graphs using Shiny (and R of course).</p>
