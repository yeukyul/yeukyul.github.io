        <h1>About Me</h1>
        <p class = "description"> I am a currently a junior in <strong>Carnegie Mellon University</strong>, majoring in <strong>Statistics</strong> and minoring in <strong>Computer Science</strong>. 
        <br>
        There are three things in the world that interest me the most, the first being Statistics. To me, nothing is more beautiful than the smooth density curve that has the power of predicting the future and informing us underlying truth.</p>
        <p class = "description">The second thing is <strong>computer science</strong>. My initial hope of entering this field is to use computing to empower advance statistical data processing and analysis, but I'm nonetheless involved in building websites, apps, and games! I am currently a mentor and teaching assistant in computer science, mentoring both in school and <strong>Coursera</strong>. 
        <p class = "description">The last thing is graphics. I am particularly keen in studying how visual element can enhance effectiveness of interfaces and product design. Therefore I am currenly involved in user centered researches, hopefully to get hands on the field. My hope is that eventually I can incorporate the best of three worlds togther and create products (really anything) that help can make peoples' life easier.</p>

    <h1>What I'm Up to Now</h1>
            <p class = "description">
                I am always eager to try new things, both intellectually and physically. </p>
            <p class = "description">I am early on in data visualization course, during which I have been making plots for different datasets and for different visualization purposes. In the upcoming month, I will be learning how to create interactive graphs using Shiny in R and D3.js.</p>
        
            <p class = "description">Outside of school, I have been building websites. I am deeply troubled by the fact that nowadays how people often sacrifice usability for aesthetics, and therefore I am exploring effective communication in design.</p>
                
            <p class = "description">In terms of life, I am a regular jogger, swimmer, and squash player. Speaking of weird sports, I have done kayaking, archery, pistol shooting, hot yoga, and krav maga before. My recent favorite sports is, well, long boarding. </p>
